### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**dipoo27/dipoo27** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

1)Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

Review the Chada Tech Clocks Functional Requirements, located in the Supporting Materials section.
Review the following flowchart, as it is a graphical representation of the logic you will use in relation to your applicationâ€™s sequence of functions.
Your code should be properly modularized and written in functions so that your main() has the least amount of code.
Before you begin coding, remember that you must demonstrate industry standard best practices in all your code to ensure clarity, consistency, and efficiency. This includes:
Inserting in-line comments to denote your changes and to briefly describe the functionality of the code
Using appropriate variable, parameter, and other naming conventions throughout your code
When your solution is finished, zip your project including all components (CPP, H, and any other files used).

2)What did you do particularly well?

When I have start this course at the first place I was very nervous and I didnâ€™t think that I could do it because of my past experience that I donâ€™t have any experience in coding at all and Now I know C++ is language that is bit tough than the Java and Python, so far I learned in these past three weeks is how  C++ handles both users and input and output information to the screen. At the same time, most of the C++ programming dialect is like that of Java and Python, but how you compose the input and yield articulations are interests diverse. Going back to the subject of C++ being one of the more challenging programming dialects to memorize, after perusing the assets and working through the exercises and labs, I have come to see that C++ isnâ€™t all that awful. You have got to apply yourself and be willing to memorize unused strategies. During these past three weeks, there have been a few exercises and labs where I have been stuck. To urge through that, I have come to out to my cousin brother who have already graduate and now working with an company taking and other developers on the web to urge their input. Utilizing these procedures is exceptionally advantageous as they permit you to inquire those with real-world involvement and may have way better ways of going almost an issue than at first thought. You moreover learn a part from your peers.

3) Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, 
secure, and so on?
â€¢	Concurring to me the stream chart totally depicts the method from the consistent beginning to the conclusion. Beginning from setting the current time till the time machine gets stops, I explained everything in detail within the stream chart. 
â€¢	As to making this pseudo code human readable, I didnâ€™t incorporate any factors, so itâ€™ll be simpler for them to get it the calculation. But if we generally talk almost factors at that point, Iâ€™ll take factors to require input from the clients and make choices in like manner.
â€¢	Moreover, in case I need to put a few codes interior my primary strategy at that point itâ€™ll be the code for selecting one of the favorable choices from the client i.e. On or modified and encourage code based on a choice. This code is a critical portion of this question. 
â€¢	I lean toward to form a stream chart of a problem before coding it really within the genuine life since itâ€™ll get simpler to compose a calculation or code on the off chance that youâ€™ve characterized a stream chart. Even in this address, I realized the same thing that the time-consuming process is your flowchart but when once itâ€™ll gets ready then writing code is not a big deal.




4) Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Hello, Everyone
I hope everyone is doing great, as I said that C++ wasnâ€™t all that awful. Shockingly, my discernment has changed since that point. I am uncertain in case it is the sum of work each week (that's a crazy sum of work apart for one to comprehend) or the more profundity programming dialect concepts. I would have to say that the foremost energizing thing that was secured this week was pointers. I ought to say that I am still not comprehending this all as well well, and I had to urge exterior help for the banking app extension. I am having a difficult time wrapping my head around the concept. I ordinarily can choose things rapidly, but this one is bothering me. I will examine this more and familiarize myself with it more. I certainly had detours amid this venture. It was getting to me, and I was getting disappointed very as often as possible. I had to require numerous breaks to rest my eyes. I moreover had to, as specified over, reach out to exterior help to the programming community. This methodology of getting offer assistance from the programming community could be a supportive approach that numerous individuals utilize. It beyond any doubt made a difference for me!


5) What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The victory of a Extend Chief is decided by the level of effectiveness in accomplishing the projectâ€™s essential objective, in any case of industry. The capacity to oversee ventures viably regularly depends on a Venture Managerâ€™s center set of abilities. For illustration, a effective Venture Director must be able to distinguish and relieve hazard, oversee challenging partners, and fulfill the venture deliverables. Communication, partner administration, and arranging in bolster of execution: these are the basic abilities that all Venture Supervisors must either have or create notwithstanding of the industry.

6) How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Strategy can return primitives, objects or invalid. Dodge returning invalid as much as conceivable. when we return invalid in case caller doesnâ€™t know approximately it'll hit a NullPointerException. On the off chance that caller does know about null have to be include additional checks. This extra condition here includes cyclomatic complexity and each time the strategy calls caller has got to include invalid checks. Method ought to as it were do one thing. Thatâ€™s how we apply SRP(Single Obligation Rule) to methods Avoid returning uncommon codes (-1, 0, 1 and other) from a strategy. It'll drive client code to check for enchantment numbers. Always attempt to have 0â€“3 contentions in a strategy. More than that will show your strategy needs refactoring. On the off chance that strategy takes as well numerous primitive sorts, pass a single protest.
